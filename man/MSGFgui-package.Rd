\title{MSGFgui: A graphic user interface for MSGFplus}
\description{
This package provides a GUI overlay for the MSGFplus package, and by
extension the MS-GF+ algorithm for peptide identification in LC-MS/MS data
files. Most functionality of the app is hidden behind the function
\code{\link{MSGFgui}} which summons the GUI in your browser of choice. Do
note that MSGFgui relies on a modern browser that supports HTML5, CSS3 and
SVG. This means that people trapped in Internet Explorer 8 and below will
probably have trouble getting this to work - but then again they certainly
have other things to worry about. Please consult the vignette for a
run-through of the functionality exposed in the GUI.
